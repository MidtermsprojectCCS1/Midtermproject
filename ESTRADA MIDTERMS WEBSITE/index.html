        <p>Hello! I am Craig D. Estrada, a BSCS student with a passion for exploring the world of computer science. I initially enrolled in computer studies to learn about robotics and coding. While I considered computer engineering, I ultimately chose to pursue computer science. Since enrolling, I have met new people and enjoyed my experience here.<br><br>In addition to my studies, I am a photographer. I began pursuing photography during the pandemic and am now part of Silliman University's largest photography group, the Silliman University Camera Club (SUCC). I also serve as the current Vice Chairperson for SUSG Infomedia and am a member of a production team called Awestrucks Productions.<br><br>My passion for photography has inspired me to create art that combines my major with my production skills. I look forward to finding more ways to blend these interests. was selected to represent my school in a team competition for a Science and Investigation project in the Mathematics category. My team was responsible for the mathematical aspects, and my role was to implement our ideas in code. We developed a ridge regression model to predict humidity levels in the municipalities of Siquijor. Participating in that contest sparked my interest, and I started exploring other fields, such as game development and creating command-line interface software.</p>
